# Interview Practice App

An app to stimulate professional Job Interview and help with Interview prep

## Overview
The **Interview Practice App** is a web-based tool that uses **prompt engineering** and the **OpenAI API** to help users prepare for job interviews.  
It allows for interactive interview simulations, tailored preparation strategies, and customizable question sets — making it a valuable resource for both technical and behavioral interview practice.

Later, you can continue expanding this app for personal use, professional coaching, or as a portfolio showcase.
